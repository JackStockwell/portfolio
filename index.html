                <h4>Who am I?</h4>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Jack Stockwell and welcome to my Portfolio!</p>
                <br>
                <h4>What is this place?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I am currently studying a coding Bootcamp with the University of Birmingham,
                        this portfolio is the display of the work I produced throughout my journey along with any of my own personal projects.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h4>A little about me...</h4>
                    <p>
                        I am a hard working, honest and dependable individual looking for a new career that is more compatible with my lifestyle. 
                        I have enjoyed working in a team environment while under great stress from the day-to-day operations, I have experience with dealing with a wide variety of individuals which has made me confident in my interpersonal skills. 
                        I have explored a variety of roles which has led me be open to change and have a willingness to learn new skills.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h4>What are my interests?</h4>
                <p>
                    Some of core interests include but are not limited to: Socialising, Gaming, Technology, Electronic Music as well as a bit of light Gardening.
                </p>
                    <br>
                <h4>What's my story?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have grown up in Southend-on-Sea, Essex for my entire life with my Hobby of gaming being a forefront of who I am. 
                        After taking my GCSEs I studied Games Development while at college looking to start a career in Game Development.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Once college had ended I got what was only meant to be a summer job at Adventure Island, a local theme park as a Ride Host while I searched for a University to attend/figure out what I wanted to do in life.
                        While working at Adventure Island I earned several achievements including Top Leader for 2 years running and progressed through the ranks eventually getting myself to Assistant Manager in 2021 managing up to 200 staff on a busy summer's day.
                    </p>  
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        During 2022 I desired something else in life, a new challenge and direction for me as a person. In Feb 2023, I applied for the University of Birmingham online coding bootcamp and wanted to start a future in Web Development.  
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In April 2023 I left Adventure Island on good terms with 7 years of knowledge, friendships and personal growth to acquire a new job to match my study schedule and to step outside my comfort zone.
